# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Supervised Machine Learning on Credit dataset

## Overview
When determining wheter to approve a loan or not, a lot of factors are taken into place, and some can be overlooked. The purpose of this analysis is to use a machine learning model to evaluate the factors in order to make a proper judgement on approval. Several steps in the machine learning process were utilized to ensure accurate approval of the model.
